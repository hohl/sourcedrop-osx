# SourceDrop for OS X

[SourceDrop for OS X](http://sourcedrop.net/mac) is a PasteBin client which allows you to easily share your snippets by drag and drop. Just drop your snippet on the SourceDrop icon and it will be uploaded to the configured PasteBin provider, supporting all common PasteBin providers like TinyPaste, PasteBin.com and GIST.

**You can download SourceDrop for OS X [on the App Store](http://itunes.com/mac/michaelhohl/sourcedrop).**


## Getting Started

Run the following commands to get started:

    $ git clone https://github.com/hohl/sourcedrop-osx.git
    $ open sourcedrop-osx/SourceDrop.xcworkspace

Now just press the Xcode Build button.

## Why is this open source?

This is open source since the app is free already. It is intended to be a source of sample code for everyone to benefit from. You can add your own features or maybe build a whole new app based on SourceDrop for OS X.


## License

SourceDrop for OS X is released under the [Simplified BSD License](https://github.com/hohl/sourcedrop-osx/blob/master/LICENSE).

While it is not strictly forbidden by the license, I would greatly appreciate it if you didn't redistribute this app exactly the way it is in the App Store. There's nothing stopping you, but please don't be a jerk.


## Give Back

If you want to give back in ways other than helping improving the source code, you are welcome to spread the word of [SourceDrop](http://www.sourcedrop.net/) and [@mihohl on Twitter](http://twitter.com/mihohl).
